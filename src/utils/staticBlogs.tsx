                        Dreaming of luxurious Marriott stays without breaking the bank? The Amex Platinum Travel Card might be your golden ticket (with a few twists). Lets dive into the details and see if this card helps you level up your travel game. ✈️
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-5"><span className='font-bold'>Sweet Sign-Up Bonus: 40,000 Points, 2 Free Marriott Nights…Maybe? <br /></span>
                        The Amex Platinum Travel Card often throws a whopping 40,000 reward points if you spend ₹4 lakhs in a year. Sounds tempting, right? Those points can potentially translate to 2 free nights at a Marriott property in India. But hold on to your boarding pass – there&apos;s more to the story.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-5"><span className='font-bold'>Point Redemption: Its Not Always a 1-Night Stand <br /></span>
                        While you can transfer Amex points to Marriott Bonvoy points at a 1:1 ratio, the redemption rates for hotels can be a real rollercoaster. Some budget-friendly Marriotts might cost as low as 13,000 points per night, but many popular destinations will set you back significantly more – think 20,000 points or even higher!

                        You need to be a good planner to hit the right property at the right time. Before you book that dream stay in Goa, make sure you check the award chart for that specific property. Trust us, it can save you a major point meltdown.

                    <p className="mb-5"><span className='font-bold'>Don&apos;t Expect Free Stays Every Weekend (Sorry, Weekend Warriors) ♀️ <br /></span>
                        Just because you spend ₹4 lakhs doesnt mean you will be living the high life at Marriotts all year. Remember, room availability plays a huge role. Those coveted rooms with stunning views might disappear faster than free pizza at a college party. So, be prepared to plan your trips in advance and be flexible with your travel dates. ️

                        The Amex Platinum Travel Card and Marriott Bonvoy points can be a fantastic way to score free hotel stays. However, its crucial to understand the redemption rates, point requirements, and potential limitations on room availability. ️

                        Ever wondered why that verification code lands on your phone when someone uses your &ldquo;additional card&rdquo;? Here&apos;s the key difference:

This means you have more control over transactions, as you&apos;ll receive the verification code for purchases made with the Add-on card.</li>
                            <li className="list-item list-disc mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Supplementary Card:</span> The OTP usually goes to the mobile number registered for the supplementary cardholder.
